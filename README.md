# Graph visualiser

A Java project to visualise graphs (G = V,E).

I eventually want to make this a graphing tool with different algorithms and so. (Kruskals, Dijkstras and DFS/BFS).

---------------

#### To-do
- Create system:
	to touch and create vertices
	to touch two vertices and create an edge: pop-up screen for weight?
	
	algorithms
	
#### Current Version
Just added some buttons at the bottom to maake it a bit easier for the user to use. (functionality soon to come...)
