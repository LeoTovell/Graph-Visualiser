# Graph visualiser

A Java project to visualise graphs (G = V,E).

I eventually want to make this a graphing tool with different algorithms and so. (Kruskals, Dijkstras and DFS/BFS).

---------------

#### To-do
- Stop the graph vertices overlaying UI.
- Getting weight input on new edges + displaying it next to edges.
- Kruskals Algorithm (MST).
- Dijsktras Algorithm (Shortest Path).
- Dark and Light mode for picky users.
	
#### Current Version
Finished drop-down for UI. They automatically reposition and resize depending on contents.
